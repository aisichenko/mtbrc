## Maintenance

### Rear derailleur 

- derailleur hanger parts can be bought from bike vendor, for example Santa Cruz Bronson has [this one](https://shop.santacruzbicycles.com/collections/shop-bronson-small-parts/products/do-kit-148-ta).

### Cables and hoses

- shifter cables
  - cable = cable housing + shifter cable
  - cut the shifter cable with a cable cutter and prevent cable fraying
  - cut the hose i.e. cable housing with a hose cutter tool, often you can use the same tool such as [Pedro cutter](https://www.amazon.com/Pedros-131839-Bicycle-Cable-Cutter/dp/B000IZEH3S/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1M19O72ZMT188&keywords=Pedro%27s%2BBicycle%2BCable%2BCutter%2C%2BBlack%2FYellow&qid=1661648860&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=%2Csporting%2C599&sr=1-2&th=1)
  - the cable housing has braided outside so after the cut need to round it out to fully open it up. the shifter cable should run through the housing smoothly and not get caught
- hydraulic cables
  - cut with a special hydraulic hose cutter

## When to replace components

- Brake pads: when thickness **<3 mm** (backing plate to friction material)
- - Chain: when chain length extends by > 0.8 %
