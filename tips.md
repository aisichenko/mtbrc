# Tips for maintenance and repair

## Maintenance

### Cleaning

- wash back after every ride with a bike wash such as [Finishline Super Bike Wash]([url](https://www.rei.com/product/664447/finish-line-super-bike-wash-1-liter-338-oz))

### Lubrication

- after washing bake, let the chain dry then lubricate the chain with dry lube: [Finishline Dry Lube]([url](https://www.rei.com/product/215992/finish-line-dry-lube-2-oz))

- bottom bracket remove and relube. I use the [Parktool PPL-1](https://www.parktool.com/en-us/product/polylube-1000-lubricant-tube-ppl-1)

### When do I replace...?

- Brake pads: when thickness **<3 mm** (backing plate to friction material)
- Chain: when chain length extends by > 0.8 %

### Always carry

- Multi-tool
- Chain links: [SRAM powerlock chain connector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009F96WK4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), each one is one-time use!
- Bacon strips: [Lezyne Tubeless repair kit](https://www.amazon.com/LEZYNE-Tubeless-Bicycle-Repair-Mountain/dp/B07CVJR7QZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A4S5YVQ0RX80&keywords=lezyne+bacon+strips&qid=1661649446&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=lezyne+bacon+strip%2Csporting%2C146&sr=1-1)

## Repairs

### Rear derailleur 

- derailleur hanger parts can be bought from bike vendor, for example Santa Cruz Bronson has [this one](https://shop.santacruzbicycles.com/collections/shop-bronson-small-parts/products/do-kit-148-ta).

### Cables and hoses

- shifter cables
  - cable = cable housing + shifter cable
  - cut the shifter cable with a cable cutter and prevent cable fraying
  - cut the hose i.e. cable housing with a hose cutter tool, often you can use the same tool such as [Pedro cutter](https://www.amazon.com/Pedros-131839-Bicycle-Cable-Cutter/dp/B000IZEH3S/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1M19O72ZMT188&keywords=Pedro%27s%2BBicycle%2BCable%2BCutter%2C%2BBlack%2FYellow&qid=1661648860&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=%2Csporting%2C599&sr=1-2&th=1)
  - the cable housing has braided outside so after the cut need to round it out to fully open it up. the shifter cable should run through the housing smoothly and not get caught
- hydraulic cables
  - cut with a special hydraulic hose cutter
